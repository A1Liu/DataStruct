# Binary Search Tree Program

Write a program that allows for additions, deletions, and traversals (to print the contents) of a binary search tree.  Information will be user supplied.  

When adding, if the number is already in the tree, don’t add it, but tell the user “the number is already in the tree”.  Otherwise, give a “number added” message.  

When deleting, give a “deletion done” message. If the number to be deleted is not in the tree, give a “not in tree” message.   

The user should have the option to add, delete, or do a preorder, inorder, or postorder traversal at any time.  If trying to traverse an empty tree, give a “tree is empty” message.  

This program should have at least three classes (a TreeNode class, a BinarySearchTree class, and a Runner class).  

 

Submit all .java files and output here after running the script.
