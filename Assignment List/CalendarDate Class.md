#Developing and Testing a CalendarDate class

In this project, you will develop and test a CalendarDate class.  Here are the responsibilities of the class, that is, the services that the class will provide to users:

To initialize a CalendarDate object to represent the date January 1, 2018.

To initialize a CalendarDate object from integers for the month, day-of-month, and year; if the date is invalid (for example, if the month, day-of-month, and year are 6, 31, and 2006, respectively, use 1, 1, 2018.

Return, in String form, the next date after this CalendarDate object; for example, if this CalendarDate object represents January 31, 2018, the return value would be "February 1, 2018".

Return, in String form, the date prior to this CalendarDate object; for example, if this CalendarDate object represents January 1, 2018, the return value would be "December 31, 2017".

Return, in String form, the day of the week on which this CalendarDate object falls; for example, if this CalendarDate object represents the date December 20, 2017, the return value would be "Wednesday." (HINT: Mathematically, the day of the week can be determined from any calendar date)

##Part 1
Create method specifications for the above responsibilities (in JavaDoc notation)

##Part 2
Develop the CalendarDate class; that is, determine what fields to declare and then define the methods.

##Part 3
Create a project to test your CalendarDate class.  Call each CalendarDate method at least twice.

Upload your completed files along with your output from testing the program, copied as a comment at the bottom of the program.
