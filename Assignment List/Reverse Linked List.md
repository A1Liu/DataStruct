# Reverse a Linked List Assignment
Due: Tuesday, March 6, 2018 at 9:30 am

Write a method that reverses the order of the elements of a singly liked linked list pointed to by the parameter of the method. In doing so, do not create a second list. Recursion may be useful for this method (but not required). You may use the following header:

     public void reverseList(ListNode<E> reverseThis){

This method should be added to your Linked List Program.  After adding it to the program, test it to show that it works by creating a list, printing it, calling the reverse method, then printing again.

Upload your new Linked List file here with the new output.
