#Linked List Program
Due: Friday, March 2, 2018 at 9:30 am

**Requirements:**
* Starting with an empty list of Integer references, allow the user to input additions and deletions to the list, keeping it in order.
* The inputs should be checked through Exception Handling to ensure that they are Integers.
* If a number to be added is already there, print “Already on List”, and do not add it.
* If a number to be deleted is not on the list, print “Not on List”.
* At any time, be able to print the list.  If the list is empty, print “List is empty.”
* You should also have a command to delete the entire list, and another command to quit the program.
* Make sure to include JavaDoc commenting for all methods.  Also, main( ) should be in its own .java file.


*HINTS:*

    Consider adding at the beginning of the list, at the end of the list, and elsewhere in the list.
    Consider deleting at the beginning of the list, at the end of the list, and elsewhere in the list.
    Get all additions to work before working on deletions.
    Make sure you can add or delete at least three numbers that follow each other.
    Consider that the list may be empty.

**NOTE: You are not getting a script ahead of time; the script will be run when you turn in your program, so heed the above hints.**

 

Make sure to copy your output as a comment at the bottom of your code prior to submitting it.
