# Stacks Assignment

### Part 1: Stack Interface
Create a Stack interface based on the specifications discussed in class and in the videos.  
* It should include only the four methods presented in the notes and video (besides size( )).  
* The Interface should be generalized with a type parameter (<E>).  
* All JavaDoc commenting is required.

### Part 2: PostFix Calculator with Reference-Based Stack
For this part of the project, write a program that, using reference-based stacks, evaluates expressions in postfix notation.  
* The postfix expression will be a String consisting only of integers and mathematical operators (+, -, *, /), with each separated by a space.  Keep in mind, operators should not be pushed onto the stack.
* The program should be able to handle mathematical exceptions (such as division by zero) or realize when an expression was input incorrectly.
* Your program should implement the Stack interface you created in Part 1.  
* The class implementing the interface should add no other public methods beyond those detailed in the interface, and should contain no code specific to any task outside of a generalized stack. 
* All JavaDoc commenting is required.  
* You should also create a driver (text file) and a main( ) method to ensure that your program works.
