# DataStruct

My **Data Structures and Algorithms** assignments. You can run each *.java* file in the "runners" package, or run each *Runner.java* file individually.

## List of Assignments:
* [Calendar Program](https://github.com/A1Liu/DataStruct/blob/master/README.md#calendar-package)
* [Search and Sort](https://github.com/A1Liu/DataStruct/blob/master/README.md#search-and-sort-package)
  * Quadratic Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Radix Sort
* [Linked List](https://github.com/A1Liu/DataStruct/blob/master/README.md#linked-list-package)
  * Linked List
  * Reverse Linked List
* [Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/A1Liu/DataStruct/blob/master/README.md#doubly-linked-list-package)
* [Stacks](https://github.com/A1Liu/DataStruct/blob/master/README.md#stacks-package)

## All Projects Package
This package includes all runners for all the programs, as well as a utility class that contains methods I used very often.  

## Calendar Package
